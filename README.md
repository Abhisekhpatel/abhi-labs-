# Autonomous Action Safety System (AASS)

## The Problem
AI agents are executing real-world actions (emails, payments, database updates) with NO reliable way to prevent catastrophic mistakes in real-time.

## The Solution
A safety layer that sits between AI agents and real-world actions, providing:
- Real-time risk analysis
- Simulation before execution
- Intelligent rollback mechanisms
- Multi-layer verification

- ## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- ML: Scikit-learn + PyTorch
- Frontend: React + Tailwind
- Deployment: Docker + Railway
